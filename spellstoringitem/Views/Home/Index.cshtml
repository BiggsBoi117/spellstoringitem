    <p>
        I am a huge fan of Dungeons & Dragons, but unfortunately its parent 
        company has started monetizing its content. In addition to monetization, 
        Hasbro has come out with new rules and changes to the game without realeasing 
        a new version. Most people play the pre-2024 version of 5th edition, myself 
        included. So, having found an API for the pre-2024 version, I wanted to 
        make an easy way to play my spellcasting characters. This online spellbook 
        repository (in a pre-functioning state) will accomplish this goal.

        I am building this site with expansion in mind, with the wild, long-term 
        dream of expanding my YouTube channel to the point of including this as part 
        of a patreon. To kickstart this project, I am going to use this as the base of
        my future assignments as much as I can, creating various views and controllers
        to satisfy assignment rubrics and prepare this for a launch on my local network
        for personal use.
